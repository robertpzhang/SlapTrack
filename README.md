## SlapTrack

# Introduction
SlapTrack is an web application connected to a M5Stick-C device via BLE connection to record and store data recorded by the M5Stick-C's 6-axis IMU. 

The app tracks and records the range of movements of the limb in the roll direction of the device; then the application will display the range of motion (ROM) on the mobile portal.

SlapTrack is BMedical's senior design project. Teammates include: Robert Zhang, Ryan Homem, Ponni Theetharappan, Kyle Wysocki.
